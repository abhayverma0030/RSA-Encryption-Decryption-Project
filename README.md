# üß† RSA Encryption and Decryption Project

## üß© Definition
RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman) is one of the most common public key cryptographic algorithms.  
It uses two different keys ‚Äì a **Public Key** for encryption and a **Private Key** for decryption.  
With RSA, a message encrypted with the public key can only be read when decrypted with the matching private key.

## üéØ Outcomes / Learning
By the end of this practical, we will be able to:

- Understand the use of public and private keys in RSA.  
- Generate RSA key pairs using an online tool.  
- Encrypt a message with the Public Key.  
- Decrypt the ciphertext using the Private Key.  
- Check that the decrypted text matches the original message.

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools
- Laptop/PC with Internet connection  
- Web browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)  
- RSA Encryption/Decryption Tool: [https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/rsa-encryption-decryption](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/rsa-encryption-decryption)  
- A simple sample message for testing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Steps

### **Step 1:**  
Open your web browser on the laptop/PC.  
In the address bar type:  
üëâ [https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/rsa-encryption-decryption](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/rsa-encryption-decryption)  
This will open the RSA Encryption and Decryption tool.

---

### **Step 2:**  
Scroll down and click on **‚ÄúGenerate RSA Key Pair.‚Äù**  
The tool will create a **Public Key** and a **Private Key.**  
These are the keys we will use for encryption and decryption.

---

### **Step 3:**  
Scroll to the **Encrypt** section.  
In the message box, type a simple text like `"Hello RSA Encryption"`.  
Then click on the **Encrypt** button.

---

### **Step 4:**  
After clicking **Encrypt**, the tool will show an unreadable text called **Ciphertext**.  
Copy this ciphertext ‚Äî we‚Äôll use it to decrypt later.

---

### **Step 5:**  
Scroll down to the **Decrypt** section.  
Paste the **Ciphertext** you copied.  
Click the **Decrypt** button.

---

### **Step 6:**  
The tool will show the **original plain text** message you typed earlier.  
This proves that RSA encryption and decryption worked correctly.

---

### **Step 7 (Conclusion):**  
In this project, we generated RSA keys, encrypted a message using the Public Key,  
and decrypted it using the Private Key to get back the original message.
